Stock Information GUI

This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter and yfinance that allows the user to enter a stock ticker and display information about the stock. The GUI displays the information in a text widget and includes a "Quit" button to close the window.

Requirements
To run this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You will also need to install the yfinance library, which can be installed using pip  

Usage
To use the program, simply run the stock_info_gui.py file in your Python environment

When the GUI opens, enter a stock ticker in the input box and click the "Display Info" button to display information about the stock. The stock information will be displayed in the text widget. You can click the "Quit" button to close the window.


Customization
You can customize the program to display additional stock information or modify the GUI to suit your needs. The display_stock_info() function in the code retrieves the stock information using the yfinance library and inserts it into the text widget. You can modify this function to include additional information or to format the information differently.

The GUI can also be customized using the Tkinter library. You can modify the layout of the GUI or add additional widgets to suit your needs.
